The data set was taken from UCI machine learning repository.
The original dataset version was collected by Tanvir Ahmad, Assia Munir, Sajjad Haider Bhatti, 
Muhammad Aftab, and Muhammad Ali Raza (Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan) and made available 
by them on FigShare under the Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0: freedom to share and adapt the material) copyright in July 2017.

The current version of the dataset was elaborated by Davide Chicco (Krembil Research Institute, Toronto, Canada) 
and donated to the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository under the same Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)
copyright in January 2020. Davide Chicco can be reached at <davidechicco '@' davidechicco.it> 

The dataset contains medical records of 299 heart failure patients, where each patient is characterized by 13 clinical features.
The created unsupervised ML model identifies risk factors of heart failure based on the Kmeans clustering algorithm
